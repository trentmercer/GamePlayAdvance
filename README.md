This project is a forked from [gba.js](https://github.com/endrift/gbajs). 

GamePlayAdvance is a completely javascript-based game emulator for all gameboyadvance supported files.

## Why web based?

Historically, it has been a daunting process to use game emulators on mobile devices. Emulators are prohibited from being published as apps by some companies, so an app download in the traditional sense is not possible. 

This forces us to look to the web - specifically, PWAs!

## What's a PWA?

Progressive Web Applications are the perfect compromise here. A PWA is a webpage that creates an app-like experience for mobile users. The great thing about a PWA is it's compatible with any device that has an internet connection. (Its only a website after all... if it can connect to it, it can run it!)

## Disclaimer

Do not emulate ROMs if you have not purchased them.
